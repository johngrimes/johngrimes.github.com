          <p>John worked as a Business Analyst on a business intelligence reporting project within SIS.</p>
          <p>I found John to be a quiet achiever who was very thorough, enthusiastic and personable. He was considered popular
            and was well regarded by both the business and technical areas for BA skills as well as his ability to rapidly
            gain knowledge about business processes and relate potential project outcomes in business terms.
          </p>
          <p>I am pleased to be able to recommend John as a prospective employee or contractor.</p>
